The criterion specifies no diabetes mellitus treated with insulin, but the presence of diabetes itself may be a concern. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, which may indicate anemia, and the creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, which could suggest impaired renal function, though creatinine clearance is not specified. These factors combined suggest the patient does not meet the trial's inclusion criteria."
