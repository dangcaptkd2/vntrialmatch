- keywords: Specific trial-related terms and abbreviations
- mesh_terms_conditions: Medical Subject Headings for conditions

1. CONDITIONS: Extract specific disease names, conditions, syndromes, or health issues
   - Examples: "Non Small Cell Lung Cancer", "EGFR Activating Mutation", "Diabetes Type 2"
   - Include specific subtypes, mutations, or variants when mentioned
   - LIMIT: Maximum 5 most important conditions

2. INTERVENTIONS: Extract current or previous treatments, medications, procedures
   - Examples: "Osimertinib", "Chemotherapy", "Radiation Therapy", "Surgery"
   - Include drug names, treatment types, and procedures
   - LIMIT: Maximum 5 most important interventions

3. KEYWORDS: Extract trial-relevant terms, abbreviations, and specific identifiers
   - Examples: "NSCLC", "EGFR", "Adjuvant", "Metastatic"
   - Focus on terms commonly used in clinical trial descriptions
   - LIMIT: Maximum 8 most important keywords

4. BIOMARKERS: Extract genetic markers, molecular characteristics, or test results
   - Examples: "EGFR DEL19", "EGFR L858R", "PD-L1 positive", "ALK fusion"
   - LIMIT: Maximum 5 most important biomarkers

5. DEMOGRAPHICS: Extract relevant demographic information for trial eligibility
   - Age ranges, gender, performance status, etc.

IMPORTANT: 
- Extract only the most specific and relevant terms
- Avoid generic terms that won't help narrow down trial matches
- Focus on terms that would appear in ClinicalTrials.gov data
- Include both full names and common abbreviations when appropriate
- Prioritize terms that are most likely to appear in clinical trial titles and conditions
- Be selective - quality over quantity

- Include common misspellings or variations
- Focus on terms that would appear in clinical trial descriptions
- Keep terms specific and relevant to clinical trial matching

- 'ineligible': Patient clearly does not meet the criterion based on available information  
- 'unknown': Use this when you are unsure, when information is missing, or when the criterion is ambiguous

IMPORTANT: When in doubt, classify as 'unknown'. It is better to be conservative and request more information than to make assumptions.

Explanation guidelines:
- Be concise but specific about why you made your classification
- Reference specific information from the patient profile when possible
- If information is missing, clearly state what additional information would be needed
- If you are unsure about the interpretation of the criterion, explain why
